# Rick and Morty React App :heavy_check_mark:

Create a ReactJS app using the Rick & Morty [API](rickandmortyapi.com)
* [X] Display the profiles of the characters (either with pagination or showing the first page only).
* [X] The profile of a character should include:
      <ul>
        <li>Image</li>
        <li>Character information (name, species, etc).</li>
        <li>Origin and location information (name, dimension, amount of residents, etc).</li>
        <li>Name of the chapters the character is featured on.</li>
      </ul>
* [X] The API provides REST and GraphQL versions, for this exercise you should use the REST version.
* [X] You are free to use any library/framework or even language. Be ready to explain the rationale for your choices.
* [X] The exercise should be submitted in a public repository.
* [X]  Running your solution requires no global dependencies (besides node/npm/yarn) and it's possible to run it with only one command (besides yarn/npm install).
* [X] Write the code with production standards in mind.


Project [DEMO](https://rickandmortysomekindofwallflower.netlify.app/characters).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
